    ## Instructions
    * This looks like a map, but it's actually a mathematical depiction of a network; called a graph. It shows the network of airports in the US in the year you select on the slider above the visual.
    * The edges, or lines, are the flights between the airports.
    * The size and color of the airport nodes are proportional to the betweenness centrality of the airport.
    * Betweeness centrality is a measure of how important a node is in a network. In this case, it is a measure of the number of shortest routes that travel through that location.
    * Therefore, larger the node, the more important it is to the network.
    * Move the slider to generate a new graph for the year you select.
